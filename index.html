Problems with education around the world
</a>
</p>
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
    According to India Today (2025), UNESCO said that around 272 million children <br> worldwide are currently out of school. 
    This is because education is an important thing <br> for everyone. Yet, a lot of people don’t have access to it. 

    <br>
    <br>

    In the Philippines, a lot of children still can’t read or write even though they’re already <br> grown up. 
    The Philippine Statistics Authority (2024) said that about 10.7 million Filipinos <br> are not enrolled based on the data
    from the 2020 Census of Population and Housing. <br> This proves that many countries, including the Philippines, are 
    struggling to get <br> a proper education.

<h3>What is Being Done?</h3>
<p>
    The Philippines is trying to solve this issue by providing different kinds of 
    programs. <br> Some of theese programs are the Alternative Learning System (ALS), Pantawid Pamilyang <br> 
    Pilipino Program (4Ps), and School-Based Feeding Programs. These programs help poor <br>
    families and to reduce the amount of hildren who can’t go to school.
</p>

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>
    As students, our mission is to highlight the importance of quality education and its accessibility. <br>
    On this website, we explain the problems in education, the solutions that are being implemented, <br>
    and to spread awareness and convince people to help in reducing the number of children who <br> aren’t 
    going to school. Because of this, we help by making sure that all children have access to <br> quality education.
</p>

<h3>Call to Action</h3>
<p>Join us in ensuring all children have access to quality education. Together, we contribute to the goal of SDG 4: Quality Education. </p> <br>
